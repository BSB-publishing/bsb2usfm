# Demo Data for BSB to USFM Converter

This directory contains sample data files for testing the BSB to USFM converter.

## Files Created

### 1. sample_bsb_tables.tsv
Sample BSB tables data containing verses from:
- Genesis 1:1-5 (Creation narrative)
- Exodus 3:14 (God's name revealed)
- Matthew 1:1-2 (Jesus' genealogy with heading)
- John 3:16 (Gospel verse with footnote)

**Features demonstrated:**
- Basic verse text
- Red letter text (Jesus' words)
- Headings and formatting
- Footnotes with various styling
- Mixed Old and New Testament content
- Tab-delimited format (TSV)

### 2. sample_footnotes.tsv
Footnote styling rules for the sample verses:
- Different footnote types (fq, fqa, ft)
- Multiple footnotes per verse
- Hebrew and Greek term explanations

### 3. sample_book_names.xml
Custom book names with:
- Long names (formal titles)
- Short names (common usage)
- Abbreviations (3-letter codes)
- Both Old and New Testament examples

## Usage Examples

### Command Line
```bash
# Convert all sample books
python3 bsb2usfm.py demo_data/sample_bsb_tables.tsv -o demo_output_%.usfm

# With footnotes and custom names
python3 bsb2usfm.py demo_data/sample_bsb_tables.tsv \
  -o demo_output_%.usfm \
  -f demo_data/sample_footnotes.tsv \
  -n demo_data/sample_book_names.xml

# Convert specific books only
python3 bsb2usfm.py demo_data/sample_bsb_tables.tsv \
  -o demo_output_%.usfm \
  -b GEN -b MAT -b JHN -b REV
```

### Web Interface
1. Start the web server: `./run_web.py`
2. Visit: http://localhost:5000
3. Upload `sample_bsb_tables.tsv` as the main file
4. Optionally upload `sample_footnotes.tsv` and `sample_book_names.xml`
5. Select books or leave empty for all
6. Click "Convert to USFM"
7. Download your results

## Expected Output

The conversion should generate USFM files like:

### demo_output_GEN.usfm
```usfm
\id GEN Autogenerated BSB by bsb2usfm
\h Gen
\toc1 Genesis
\toc2 Genesis
\toc3 GEN
\mt1 Genesis
\c 1
\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and void...
```

### demo_output_MAT.usfm
```usfm
\id MAT Autogenerated BSB by bsb2usfm
\h Mat
\toc1 The Gospel According to Matthew
\toc2 Matthew
\toc3 MAT
\mt1 The Gospel According to Matthew
\s1 The Genealogy of Jesus Christ
\c 1
\v 1 This is the record of the genealogy...
```

## Notes

- This is sample data for demonstration purposes
- Real BSB data will have many more verses and complex formatting
- The footnote styling may need adjustment for your specific needs
- Book names can be customized for different language traditions

## Troubleshooting

If conversion fails:
1. Check that all files are UTF-8 encoded
2. Verify the TSV structure matches expected format (tab-delimited)
3. Ensure footnote references match verse IDs exactly
4. Check that XML is well-formed
