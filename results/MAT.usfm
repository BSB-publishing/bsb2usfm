\r (\ref Ruth 4:18–22|RUT 4:18-22\ref*; \ref Luke 3:23–38|LUK 3:23-38\ref*)
\p \v 1 This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
\b 
\q1 \v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac,
\q1 Isaac the father of Jacob,
\q1 and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
\b 
\q1 \v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar,
\q1 Perez the father of Hezron,
\q1 and Hezron the father of Ram.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Greek \fqa Aram\ft , a variant of \fqa Ram\ft ; also in verse 4; see \ref 1 Chronicles 2:9–10|ref="1CH 2:9-10"\ref*.\f*

\q1 Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth,
\q1 Obed the father of Jesse,
\q1 \v 6 and Jesse the father of David the king.
\p Next:
\b 
\q1 David was the father of Solomon by Uriah’s wife,
\q1 \v 7 Solomon the father of Rehoboam,
\q1 Rehoboam the father of Abijah,
\q1 and Abijah the father of Asa.\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Greek \fqa Asaph\ft , a variant of \fqa Asa\ft ; also in verse 8; see \ref 1 Chronicles 3:10|ref="1CH 3:10"\ref*.\f*
\b 
\q1 \v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat,
\q1 Jehoshaphat the father of Joram,
\q1 and Joram the father of Uzziah.
\b 
\q1 \v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham,

\q1 and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
\b 
\q1 \v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh,
\q1 Manasseh the father of Amon,\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Greek \fqa Am&#333;s\ft , a variant spelling of Amon; twice in this verse; see \ref 1 Chronicles 3:14|ref="1CH 3:14"\ref*.\f*
\q1 Amon the father of Josiah,
\q1 \v 11 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers
\q2 at the time of the exile to Babylon.
\p \v 12 After the exile to Babylon:
\b 
\q1 Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel,
\q1 Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
\q1 \v 13 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud,
\q1 Abiud the father of Eliakim,
\q1 and Eliakim the father of Azor.
\b 
\q1 \v 14 Azor was the father of Zadok,
\q1 Zadok the father of Achim,
\q1 and Achim the father of Eliud.
\b 
\q1 \v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar,
\q1 Eleazar the father of Matthan,
\q1 Matthan the father of Jacob,
\q1 \v 16 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary,
\q2 of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\p \v 17 In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
\s1 The Birth of Jesus
\r (\ref Isaiah 7:10–16|ISA 7:10-16\ref*; \ref Luke 2:1–7|LUK 2:1-7\ref*)
\p \v 18 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. \v 19 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.
\p \v 20 But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. \v 21 She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus,\f + \fr 1:21 \fqa Jesus \ft means \fqa The LORD saves\ft .\f* because He will save His people from their sins.”
\p \v 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
\b 
\q1 \v 23 “Behold, the virgin will be with child
\q2 and will give birth to a son,
\q1 and they will call Him Immanuel”\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Literally \fqa they will call His name Immanuel\ft ; \ref Isaiah 7:14|ref="ISA 7:14"\ref* (see also DSS)\f*
\q2 ( which means, “God with us”\f + \fr 1:23 \ft See \ref Isaiah 7:14|ref="ISA 7:14"\ref*, Isaiah 8:8, and Isaiah 8:10.\f*).
\p \v 24 When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife. \v 25 But he had no union with her\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Literally \fqa he did not know her\f* until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.
\c 2
\s1 The Pilgrimage of the Magi
\r (\ref Micah 5:1–6|MIC 5:1-6\ref*)
\p \v 1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, \v 2 asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star in the east\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or \fqa as it rose\f* and have come to worship Him.”
\p \v 3 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. \v 4 And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
\p \v 5 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
\b 
\q1 \v 6 ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
\q2 are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,
\q1 for out of you will come a ruler
\q2 who will be the shepherd of My people Israel.’\f + \fr 2:6 \ft \ref Micah 5:2|ref="MIC 5:2"\ref*; see also 2 Samuel 5:2.\f*”
\p \v 7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared. \v 8 And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.”
\p \v 9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was. \v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight. \v 11 On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
\p \v 12 And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.
\s1 The Flight to Egypt
\r (\ref Hosea 11:1–7|HOS 11:1-7\ref*)
\p \v 13 When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.”
\p \v 14 So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, \v 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”\f + \fr 2:15 \ft \ref Hosea 11:1|ref="HOS 11:1"\ref*\f*
\s1 Weeping and Great Mourning
\r (\ref Jeremiah 31:1–25|JER 31:1-25\ref*)
\p \v 16 When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi. \v 17 Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
\b 
\q1 \v 18 “A voice is heard in Ramah,
\q2 weeping and great mourning,
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children
\q2 and refusing to be comforted,
\q2 because they are no more.”\f + \fr 2:18 \ft \ref Jeremiah 31:15|ref="JER 31:15"\ref*\f*
\s1 The Return to Nazareth
\r (\ref Luke 2:39–40|LUK 2:39-40\ref*)
\p \v 19 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. \v 20 “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are now dead.”
\p \v 21 So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel. \v 22 But when he learned that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, \v 23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”

\s1 The Mission of John the Baptist
\r (\ref Isaiah 40:1–5|ISA 40:1-5\ref*; \ref Mark 1:1–8|MRK 1:1-8\ref*; \ref Luke 3:1–20|LUK 3:1-20\ref*; \ref John 1:19–28|JHN 1:19-28\ref*)
\p \v 1 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea \v 2 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” \v 3 This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:
\b 
\q1 “A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
\q2 ‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
\q2 make straight paths for Him.’”\f + \fr 3:3 \ft \ref Isaiah 40:3|ref="ISA 40:3"\ref* (see also LXX)\f*
\p \v 4 John wore a garment of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. \v 5 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan. \v 6 Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
\p \v 7 But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? \v 8 Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. \v 9 And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. \v 10 The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
\p \v 11 I baptize you with water\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Or \fqa in water\f* for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Or \fqa in the Holy Spirit and in fire\f* \v 12 His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
\s1 The Baptism of Jesus
\r (\ref Mark 1:9–11|MRK 1:9-11\ref*; \ref Luke 3:21–22|LUK 3:21-22\ref*; \ref John 1:29–34|JHN 1:29-34\ref*)
\p \v 13 At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. \v 14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”
\p \wj \v 15 “Let it be so now,”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.”\wj* Then John permitted Him.
\p \v 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft NA, BYZ, and TR \fqa the heavens were opened to Him\f* and He saw\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Or \fqa and he saw\ft ; see \ref John 1:32–33|ref="JHN 1:32-33"\ref*.\f* the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. \v 17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!”
\c 4
\s1 The Temptation of Jesus
\r (\ref Mark 1:12–13|MRK 1:12-13\ref*; \ref Luke 4:1–13|LUK 4:1-13\ref*)
\p \v 1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. \v 2 After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.
\p \v 3 The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
\p \v 4 But Jesus answered, \wj “It is written:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘Man shall not live on bread alone,\wj*
\q2 \wj but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’\f + \fr 4:4 \ft \ref Deuteronomy 8:3|ref="DEU 8:3"\ref*\f*”\wj*
\p \v 5 Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. \v 6 “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written:
\b 
\q1 ‘He will command His angels concerning You,
\q2 and they will lift You up in their hands,
\q1 so that You will not strike Your foot
\q2 against a stone.’\f + \fr 4:6 \ft \ref Psalm 91:11–12|ref="PSA 91:11-12"\ref*\f*”
\p \v 7 Jesus replied, \wj “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’\f + \fr 4:7 \ft \ref Deuteronomy 6:16|ref="DEU 6:16"\ref*\f*”\wj*
\p \v 8 Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. \v 9 “All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.”
\p \wj \v 10 “Away from Me, Satan!”\wj* Jesus told him. \wj “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’\f + \fr 4:10 \ft \ref Deuteronomy 6:13|ref="DEU 6:13"\ref*\f*”\wj*
\p \v 11 Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.
\s1 Jesus Begins His Ministry
\r (\ref Isaiah 9:1–7|ISA 9:1-7\ref*; \ref Mark 1:14–15|MRK 1:14-15\ref*; \ref Luke 4:14–15|LUK 4:14-15\ref*)
\p \v 12 When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee. \v 13 Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, \v 14 to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
\b 
\q1 \v 15 “Land of Zebulun
\q2 and land of Naphtali,
\q1 the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q2 Galilee of the Gentiles —
\q1 \v 16 the people living in darkness
\q2 have seen a great light;
\q1 on those living in the land of the shadow of death,
\q2 a light has dawned.”\f + \fr 4:16 \ft \ref Isaiah 9:1–2|ref="ISA 9:1-2"\ref*\f*
\p \v 17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, \wj “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”\wj*
\s1 The First Disciples
\r (\ref Mark 1:16–20|MRK 1:16-20\ref*; \ref Luke 5:1–11|LUK 5:1-11\ref*; \ref John 1:35–42|JHN 1:35-42\ref*)
\p \v 18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. \wj \v 19 “Come, follow Me,”\wj* Jesus said, \wj “and I will make you fishers of men.”\wj* \v 20 And at once they left their nets and followed Him.
\p \v 21 Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them, \v 22 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.
\s1 Jesus Heals the Multitudes
\r (\ref Mark 3:7–12|MRK 3:7-12\ref*; \ref Luke 6:17–19|LUK 6:17-19\ref*)
\p \v 23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. \v 24 News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.
\p \v 25 Large crowds followed Him, having come from Galilee, the Decapolis,\f + \fr 4:25 \ft That is, the Ten Cities\f* Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\s1 The Sermon on the Mount
\p \v 1 When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to Him, \v 2 and He began to teach them, saying:
\s1 The Beatitudes
\r (\ref Psalm 1:1–6|PSA 1:1-6\ref*; \ref Luke 6:20–23|LUK 6:20-23\ref*)
\q1 \v 3 \wj “Blessed are the poor in spirit,\wj*
\q2 \wj for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\wj*
\q1 \v 4 \wj Blessed are those who mourn,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will be comforted.\wj*
\q1 \v 5 \wj Blessed are the meek,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will inherit the earth.\f + \fr 5:5 \ft Or \fqa Blessed are those who exercise strength under control, for they will inherit the land\ft ; see \ref Psalm 37:11|ref="PSA 37:11"\ref*.\f*\wj*
\q1 \v 6 \wj Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will be filled.\wj*
\q1 \v 7 \wj Blessed are the merciful,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will be shown mercy.\wj*
\q1 \v 8 \wj Blessed are the pure in heart,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will see God.\wj*
\q1 \v 9 \wj Blessed are the peacemakers,\wj*
\q2 \wj for they will be called sons of God.\wj*
\q1 \v 10 \wj Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,\wj*
\q2 \wj for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\wj*
\p \v 11 \wj Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. \v 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.\wj*
\s1 Salt and Light
\r (\ref Mark 9:49–50|MRK 9:49-50\ref*; \ref Luke 14:34–35|LUK 14:34-35\ref*; \ref Philippians 2:12–18|PHP 2:12-18\ref*)
\p \v 13 \wj You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.\wj*
\p \v 14 \wj You are the light of the world. A city on a hill\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Literally \fqa A city lying on a hill\f* cannot be hidden. \v 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. \v 16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\wj*
\s1 The Fulfillment of the Law
\p \v 17 \wj Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. \v 18 For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.\wj*
\p \v 19 \wj So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. \v 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\wj*
\s1 Anger and Reconciliation
\r (\ref Luke 12:57–59|LUK 12:57-59\ref*)
\p \v 21 \wj You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’\f + \fr 5:21 \ft \ref Exodus 20:13|ref="EXO 20:13"\ref*; Deuteronomy 5:17\f* and ‘Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ \v 22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother\f + \fr 5:22 \ft BYZ and TR include \fqa without cause\ft .\f* will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’\f + \fr 5:22 \fqa Raca \ft is an Aramaic expression of contempt.\f* will be subject to the Sanhedrin.\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Or \fqa the Council\f* But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell.\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Or \fqa the hell of fire\ft ; Greek \fqa the Gehenna of fire\f*\wj*
\p \v 23 \wj So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, \v 24 leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.\wj*
\p \v 25 \wj Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. \v 26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.\f + \fr 5:26 \ft Greek \fqa kodrant&#275;n\ft ; that is, a Roman copper coin worth about 1/64 of a denarius\f*\wj*
\s1 Adultery

\p \v 27 \wj You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’\f + \fr 5:27 \ft \ref Exodus 20:14|ref="EXO 20:14"\ref*; Deuteronomy 5:18\f* \v 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. \v 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\f + \fr 5:29 \ft Greek \fqa Gehenna\ft ; also in verse 30\f* \v 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell.\wj*
\s1 Divorce
\r (\ref Deuteronomy 24:1–5|DEU 24:1-5\ref*; \ref Luke 16:18|LUK 16:18\ref*)
\p \v 31 \wj It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’\f + \fr 5:31 \ft \ref Deuteronomy 24:1|ref="DEU 24:1"\ref*\f* \v 32 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, brings adultery upon her.\f + \fr 5:32 \ft Or \fqa causes her to commit adultery\f* And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\wj*
\s1 Oaths and Vows
\r (\ref Numbers 30:1–16|NUM 30:1-16\ref*)
\p \v 33 \wj Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’\f + \fr 5:33 \ft \ref Numbers 30:2|ref="NUM 30:2"\ref*\f* \v 34 But I tell you not to swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; \v 35 or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. \v 36 Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. \v 37 Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more comes from the evil one.\f + \fr 5:37 \ft Or \fqa from evil\f*\wj*
\s1 Love Your Enemies
\r (\ref Leviticus 24:17–23|LEV 24:17-23\ref*; \ref Luke 6:27–36|LUK 6:27-36\ref*)

If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also; \v 40 if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well; \v 41 and if someone forces you to go one mile,\f + \fr 5:41 \ft Greek \fqa one milion\ft ; that is, a Roman mile, approximately 4,855 feet or 1,480 meters\f* go with him two miles.\f + \fr 5:41 \ft Literally \fqa go with him two.\f* \v 42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\wj*

He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. \v 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same? \v 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even Gentiles do the same?\wj*
\p \v 48 \wj Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.[’’]\wj*
\c 6
\s1 Giving to the Needy

\p \v 2 \wj So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. \v 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, \v 4 so that your giving may be in secret.

\s1 The Lord’s Prayer
\r (\ref Luke 11:1–4|LUK 11:1-4\ref*)
\p \v 5 \wj And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. \v 6 But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\wj*
\p \v 7 \wj And when you pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard. \v 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.\wj*
\p \v 9 \wj So then, this is how you should pray:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘Our Father in heaven,\wj*
\q2 \wj hallowed be Your name.\wj*
\q1 \v 10 \wj Your kingdom come,\wj*
\q2 \wj Your will be done,\wj*
\q2 \wj on earth as it is in heaven.\wj*
\q1 \v 11 \wj Give us this day our daily bread.\wj*
\q1 \v 12 \wj And forgive us our debts,\wj*
\q2 \wj as we also have forgiven our debtors.\wj*
\q1 \v 13 \wj And lead us not into temptation,\wj*
\q2 \wj but deliver us from the evil one.\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Or \fqa from evil\ft ; BYZ and TR include \fqa For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen.\f*’\wj*
\p \v 14 \wj For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. \v 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours.\wj*
\s1 Proper Fasting
\p \v 16 \wj When you fast, do not be somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. \v 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, \v 18 so that your fasting will not be obvious to men, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\wj*
\s1 Treasures in Heaven

\s1 The Lamp of the Body

\p \v 24 \wj No one can serve two masters: Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\wj*
\s1 Do Not Worry
\r (\ref Luke 12:22–31|LUK 12:22-31\ref*)
\p \v 25 \wj Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? \v 26 Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? \v 27 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?\f + \fr 6:27 \ft Or \fqa a single cubit to his height\ft ; a cubit was approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters.\f*\wj*
\p \v 28 \wj And why do you worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor or spin. \v 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these. \v 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?\wj*
\p \v 31 \wj Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ \v 32 For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. \v 33 But seek first the kingdom of God\f + \fr 6:33 \ft SBL, WH, and NE \fqa seek first His kingdom\ft ; see also \ref Luke 12:31|ref="LUK 12:31"\ref*.\f* and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.\wj*
\p \v 34 \wj Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.[’’]\wj*

\p \v 15 \wj Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. \v 16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? \v 17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. \v 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. \v 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. \v 20 So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.\wj*
\p \v 21 \wj Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven. \v 22 Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’\wj*
\p \v 23 \wj Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’\wj*
\s1 The House on the Rock
\r (\ref Luke 6:46–49|LUK 6:46-49\ref*)

\p \v 1 After Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.\f + \fr 11:1 \ft That is, in the towns of Galilee\f*
\p \v 2 Meanwhile John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent his disciples\f + \fr 11:2 \ft BYZ and TR \fqa he sent two of his disciples\f* \v 3 to ask Him, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”

\r (\ref Malachi 3:1–5|MAL 3:1-5\ref*; \ref Luke 7:24–35|LUK 7:24-35\ref*)
\p \v 7 As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \wj “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? \v 8 Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’ palaces. \v 9 What then did you go out to see? A prophet?

\s1 Woe to the Unrepentant
\r (\ref Luke 10:13–16|LUK 10:13-16\ref*)
\p \v 20 Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. \wj \v 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. \v 22 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.\wj*
\p \v 23 \wj And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades!

\s1 Rest for the Weary
\r (\ref Luke 10:21–24|LUK 10:21-24\ref*)

\p \v 1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them. \v 2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
\p \v 3 Jesus replied, \wj “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? \v 4 He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread,\f + \fr 12:4 \ft Or \fqa the Bread of the Presence\f* which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests.\wj*

\s1 Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
\r (\ref Mark 3:1–6|MRK 3:1-6\ref*; \ref Luke 6:6–11|LUK 6:6-11\ref*)
\p \v 9 Moving on from there, Jesus entered their synagogue, \v 10 and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
\p \v 11 He replied, \wj “If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? \v 12 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”\wj*
\p \v 13 Then Jesus said to the man, \wj “Stretch out your hand.”\wj* So he stretched it out, and it was restored to full use, just like the other. \v 14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
\s1 God’s Chosen Servant
\r (\ref Isaiah 42:1–9|ISA 42:1-9\ref*)
\p \v 15 Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all, \v 16 warning them not to make Him known. \v 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:

\q1 I will put My Spirit on Him,

\r (\ref Mark 3:20–27|MRK 3:20-27\ref*; \ref Luke 11:14–23|LUK 11:14-23\ref*)
\p \v 22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed the man so that he could speak and see. \v 23 The crowds were astounded and asked, “Could this be the Son of David?”
\p \v 24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Only by Beelzebul,\f + \fr 12:24 \ft WH \fqa Beezeboul\ft ; Vulgate \fqa Beelzebub\ft ; also in verse 27\f* the prince of demons, does this man drive out demons.”
\p \v 25 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, \wj “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. \v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? \v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. \v 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\wj*
\p \v 29 \wj Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.\wj*

\s1 The Unpardonable Sin
\r (\ref Mark 3:28–30|MRK 3:28-30\ref*)
\p \v 31 \wj Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. \v 32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come.\wj*
\s1 Good and Bad Fruit
\r (\ref Luke 6:43–45|LUK 6:43-45\ref*)
\p \v 33 \wj Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is known by its fruit. \v 34 You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks. \v 35 The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure. \v 36 But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. \v 37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”\wj*
\s1 The Sign of Jonah
\r (\ref Jonah 3:1–10|JON 3:1-10\ref*; \ref Luke 11:29–32|LUK 11:29-32\ref*)
\p \v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”
\p \v 39 Jesus replied, \wj “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. \v 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\wj*
\p \v 41 \wj The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here. \v 42 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.\wj*

\r (\ref Mark 4:1–9|MRK 4:1-9\ref*; \ref Luke 8:4–8|LUK 8:4-8\ref*)
\p \v 1 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. \v 2 Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.
\p \v 3 And He told them many things in parables, saying, \wj “A farmer went out to sow his seed. \v 4 And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.\wj*
\p \v 5 \wj Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. \v 6 But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.\wj*
\p \v 7 \wj Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings.\wj*
\p \v 8 \wj Still other seed fell on good soil and produced a crop — a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.\wj*
\p \v 9 \wj He who has ears,\f + \fr 13:9 \ft BYZ and TR \fqa ears to hear\ft ; also in verse 43\f* let him hear.”\wj*
\s1 The Purpose of Jesus’ Parables
\r (\ref Isaiah 6:1–13|ISA 6:1-13\ref*; \ref Mark 4:10–12|MRK 4:10-12\ref*; \ref Luke 8:9–10|LUK 8:9-10\ref*)
\p \v 10 Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?”
\p \v 11 He replied, \wj “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. \v 12 Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. \v 13 This is why I speak to them in parables:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘Though seeing, they do not see;\wj*
\q2 \wj though hearing, they do not hear or understand.’\f + \fr 13:13 \ft See \ref Deuteronomy 29:4|ref="DEU 29:4"\ref*, Isaiah 42:20, Jeremiah 5:21, and Ezekiel 12:2.\f*\wj*
\p \v 14 \wj In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;\wj*
\q2 \wj you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.\wj*
\q1 \v 15 \wj For this people’s heart has grown callous;\wj*
\q2 \wj they hardly hear with their ears,\wj*
\q2 \wj and they have closed their eyes.\wj*
\q1 \wj Otherwise they might see with their eyes,\wj*
\q2 \wj hear with their ears,\wj*
\q2 \wj understand with their hearts,\wj*
\q1 \wj and turn, and I would heal them.’\f + \fr 13:15 \ft \ref Isaiah 6:9–10|ref="ISA 6:9-10"\ref* (see also LXX)\f*\wj*
\p \v 16 \wj But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. \v 17 For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Sower Explained
\r (\ref Mark 4:13–20|MRK 4:13-20\ref*; \ref Luke 8:11–15|LUK 8:11-15\ref*)
\p \v 18 \wj Consider, then, the parable of the sower: \v 19 When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown\f + \fr 13:19 \ft Literally \fqa the one sown\ft ; also in verses 20, 22, and 23\f* along the path.\wj*
\p \v 20 \wj The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. \v 21 But since he has no root, he remains for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.\wj*
\p \v 22 \wj The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.\wj*
\p \v 23 \wj But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop — a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.”\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Weeds
\r (\ref Ezekiel 17:1–10|EZK 17:1-10\ref*)
\p \v 24 Jesus put before them another parable: \wj “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. \v 25 But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away. \v 26 When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.\wj*
\p \v 27 \wj The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’\wj*
\p \v 28 \wj ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.\wj*
\p \wj So the servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’\wj*
\p \v 29 \wj ‘No,’ he said, ‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them. \v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’”\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Mustard Seed
\r (\ref Mark 4:30–34|MRK 4:30-34\ref*; \ref Luke 13:18–19|LUK 13:18-19\ref*)
\p \v 31 He put before them another parable: \wj “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field. \v 32 Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Leaven
\r (\ref Luke 13:20–21|LUK 13:20-21\ref*)
\p \v 33 He told them still another parable: \wj “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”\wj*
\s1 I Will Open My Mouth in Parables
\r (\ref Psalm 78:1–72|PSA 78:1-72\ref*)
\p \v 34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable. \v 35 So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:
\b 
\q1 “I will open My mouth in parables;
\q2 I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”\f + \fr 13:35 \ft \ref Psalm 78:2|ref="PSA 78:2"\ref* (see also LXX); SBL, NE, and WH do not include \fqa of the world\ft .\f*
\s1 The Parable of the Weeds Explained
\r (\ref Zephaniah 1:1–6|ZEP 1:1-6\ref*)
\p \v 36 Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
\p \v 37 He replied, \wj “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. \v 38 The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, \v 39 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.\wj*
\p \v 40 \wj As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age. \v 41 The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness. \v 42 And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \v 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.\f + \fr 13:43 \ft See \ref Daniel 12:3|ref="DAN 12:3"\ref*.\f*\wj*
\p \wj He who has ears, let him hear.\wj*
\s1 The Parables of the Treasure and the Pearl
\p \v 44 \wj The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.\wj*
\p \v 45 \wj Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. \v 46 When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it.\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Net
\p \v 47 \wj Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish. \v 48 When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away.\wj*
\p \v 49 \wj So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous \v 50 and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\wj*
\p \v 51 \wj Have you understood all these things?”\wj*
\p “Yes,” they answered.
\p \v 52 Then He told them, \wj “For this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”\wj*
\s1 The Rejection at Nazareth
\r (\ref Mark 6:1–6|MRK 6:1-6\ref*; \ref Luke 4:16–30|LUK 4:16-30\ref*)
\p \v 53 When Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from that place. \v 54 Coming to His hometown, He taught the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked. \v 55 “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother’s name Mary, and aren’t His brothers James, Joseph,\f + \fr 13:55 \ft BYZ and TR \fqa Joses\ft ; see \ref Mark 6:3|ref="MRK 6:3"\ref*.\f* Simon, and Judas? \v 56 Aren’t all His sisters with us as well?

\p But Jesus said to them, \wj “Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”\wj* \v 58 And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.

\s1 The Beheading of John
\r (\ref Mark 6:14–29|MRK 6:14-29\ref*; \ref Luke 9:7–9|LUK 9:7-9\ref*)
\p \v 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus \v 2 and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
\p \v 3 Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, \v 4 because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” \v 5 Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.
\p \v 6 On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod \v 7 so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.
\p \v 8 Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
\p \v 9 The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted \v 10 and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.
\p \v 11 John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.
\p \v 12 Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.
\s1 The Feeding of the Five Thousand
\r (\ref Mark 6:30–44|MRK 6:30-44\ref*; \ref Luke 9:10–17|LUK 9:10-17\ref*; \ref John 6:1–15|JHN 6:1-15\ref*)
\p \v 13 When Jesus heard  about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns. \v 14 When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
\p \v 15 When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
\p \wj \v 16 “They do not need to go away,”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “You give them something to eat.”\wj*
\p \v 17 “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
\p \wj \v 18 “Bring them here to Me,”\wj* Jesus said. \v 19 And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
\p \v 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. \v 21 About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.

\p \v 22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds. \v 23 After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone, \v 24 but the boat was already far\f + \fr 14:24 \ft Greek \fqa many stadia\ft ; a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f* from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
\p \v 25 During the fourth watch of the night,\f + \fr 14:25 \ft That is, between three and six in the morning\f* Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. \v 26 When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.
\p \v 27 But Jesus spoke up at once: \wj “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”\wj*
\p \v 28 “Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”
\p \wj \v 29 “Come,”\wj* said Jesus.
\p Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. \v 30 But when he saw the strength of the wind,\f + \fr 14:30 \ft Literally \fqa when he saw the strong wind\ft ; NE and WH do not include \fqa strong\ft .\f* he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

\p \v 32 And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down. \v 33 Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”
\s1 Jesus Heals at Gennesaret
\r (\ref Mark 6:53–56|MRK 6:53-56\ref*)
\p \v 34 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. \v 35 And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him \v 36 and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.

\s1 The Tradition of the Elders
\r (\ref Mark 7:1–13|MRK 7:1-13\ref*)
\p \v 1 Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, \v 2 “Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”
\p \v 3 Jesus replied, \wj “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? \v 4 For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’\f + \fr 15:4 \ft \ref Exodus 20:12|ref="EXO 20:12"\ref*; Deuteronomy 5:16\f* and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’\f + \fr 15:4 \ft \ref Exodus 21:17|ref="EXO 21:17"\ref*; Leviticus 20:9\f* \v 5 But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’ \v 6 he need not honor his father or mother with it.\f + \fr 15:6 \ft NE and TR (see also \ref Mark 7:12|ref="MRK 7:12"\ref*); literally \fq he need not honor his father or mother\ft ; SBL, NA, WH, and BYZ do not include \fqa or mother\ft .\f* Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. \v 7 You hypocrites!

\s1 What Defiles a Man
\r (\ref Mark 7:14–23|MRK 7:14-23\ref*)
\p \v 10 Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, \wj “Listen and understand. \v 11 A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”\wj*
\p \v 12 Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
\p \v 13 But Jesus replied, \wj “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots. \v 14 Disregard them! They are blind guides.\f + \fr 15:14 \ft Or \fqa blind guides of the blind\f* If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”\wj*
\p \v 15 Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”
\p \wj \v 16 “Do you still not understand?”\wj* Jesus asked. \wj \v 17 “Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated? \v 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man. \v 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander. \v 20 These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”\wj*
\s1 The Faith of the Canaanite Woman
\r (\ref Mark 7:24–30|MRK 7:24-30\ref*)
\p \v 21 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. \v 22 And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”
\p \v 23 But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
\p \v 24 He answered, \wj “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”\wj*
\p \v 25 The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.
\p \v 26 But Jesus replied, \wj “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”\wj*
\p \v 27 “Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs\f + \fr 15:27 \ft Or \fqa puppies\f* eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
\p \wj \v 28 “O woman,”\wj* Jesus answered, \wj “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.”\wj* And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
\s1 The Feeding of the Four Thousand
\r (\ref 2 Kings 4:42–44|2KI 4:42-44\ref*; \ref Mark 8:1–10|MRK 8:1-10\ref*)
\p \v 29 Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down. \v 30 Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them. \v 31 The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
\p \v 32 Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, \wj “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”\wj*
\p \v 33 The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”
\p \wj \v 34 “How many loaves do you have?”\wj* Jesus asked.
\p “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”
\p \v 35 And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. \v 36 Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
\p \v 37 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. \v 38 A total of four thousand men were fed, besides women and children.
\p \v 39 After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.

\r (\ref Mark 8:11–13|MRK 8:11-13\ref*; \ref Luke 12:54–56|LUK 12:54-56\ref*)
\p \v 1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came and tested Jesus by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven.
\p \v 2 But He replied, \wj “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is red,’ \v 3 and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but not the signs of the times.\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Several manuscripts do not include \fqa When evening comes... of the times. \ft from verses 2 and 3.\f* \v 4 A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”\wj* Then He left them and went away.
\s1 The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
\r (\ref Mark 8:14–21|MRK 8:14-21\ref*; \ref Luke 12:1–3|LUK 12:1-3\ref*)
\p \v 5 When they crossed to the other side, the disciples forgot to take bread. \wj \v 6 “Watch out!”\wj* Jesus told them. \wj “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”\wj*
\p \v 7 They discussed this among themselves and concluded, “It is because we did not bring any bread.”
\p \v 8 Aware of their conversation, Jesus said, \wj “You of little faith, why are you debating among yourselves about having no bread? \v 9 Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? \v 10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? \v 11 How do you not understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”\wj*
\p \v 12 Then they understood that He was not telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\s1 Peter’s Confession of Christ
\r (\ref Mark 8:27–30|MRK 8:27-30\ref*; \ref Luke 9:18–20|LUK 9:18-20\ref*; \ref John 6:67–71|JHN 6:67-71\ref*)
\p \v 13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He questioned His disciples: \wj “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”\wj*
\p \v 14 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
\p \wj \v 15 “But what about you?”\wj* Jesus asked. \wj “Who do you say I am?”\wj*
\p \v 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
\p \v 17 Jesus replied, \wj “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah!\f + \fr 16:17 \ft Greek \fqa Simon Bar-Jonah\f* For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father in heaven. \v 18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. \v 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”\wj*
\p \v 20 Then He admonished the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
\s1 Christ’s Passion Foretold
\r (\ref Mark 8:31–33|MRK 8:31-33\ref*; \ref Luke 9:21–22|LUK 9:21-22\ref*)
\p \v 21 From that time on Jesus\f + \fr 16:21 \ft NE and WH \fqa Jesus Christ\f* began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
\p \v 22 Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. “Far be it from You, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to You!”
\p \v 23 But Jesus turned and said to Peter, \wj “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”\wj*
\s1 Take Up Your Cross
\r (\ref Mark 8:34–38|MRK 8:34-38\ref*; \ref Luke 9:23–27|LUK 9:23-27\ref*)
\p \v 24 Then Jesus told His disciples, \wj “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. \v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. \v 26 What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? \v 27 For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done.\wj*

\p \v 1 After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. \v 2 There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.
\p \v 3 Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus. \v 4 Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will put up three shelters\f + \fr 17:4 \ft Or \fqa three tabernacles\f*— one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
\p \v 5 While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\f + \fr 17:5 \ft Cited in \ref 2 Peter 1:17|ref="2PE 1:17"\ref*\f* Listen to Him!” \v 6 When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown in terror.
\p \v 7 Then Jesus came over and touched them. \wj “Get up,”\wj* He said. \wj “Do not be afraid.”\wj* \v 8 And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
\p \v 9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, \wj “Do not tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”\wj*
\p \v 10 The disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
\p \v 11 Jesus replied, \wj “Elijah does indeed come, and he will restore all things. \v 12 But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”\wj*

\s1 The Boy with a Demon
\r (\ref Mark 9:14–29|MRK 9:14-29\ref*; \ref Luke 9:37–42|LUK 9:37-42\ref*)
\p \v 14 When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and knelt before Him. \v 15 “Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. \v 16 I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
\p \wj \v 17 “O unbelieving and perverse generation!”\wj* Jesus replied. \wj “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.”\wj* \v 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.
\s1 The Power of Faith

\p \v 19 Afterward the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
\p \wj \v 20 “Because you have so little faith,”\wj* He answered. \wj “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move.

\p \v 26 “From others,” Peter answered.

\p \v 2 Jesus invited a little child to stand among them. \wj \v 3 “Truly I tell you,”\wj* He said, \wj “unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \v 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. \v 5 And whoever welcomes a little child like this in My name welcomes Me.\wj*

\p \v 9 \wj The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. \v 10 So when the original workers came, they assumed they would receive more. But each of them also received a denarius.\wj*
\p \v 11 \wj On receiving their pay, they began to grumble against the landowner. \v 12 ‘These men who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.’\wj*

\p \v 29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. \v 30 And there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
\p \v 31 The crowd admonished them to be silent, but they cried out all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
\p \v 32 Jesus stopped and called them. \wj “What do you want Me to do for you?”\wj* He asked.

\p \v 14 The blind and the lame came to Him at the temple, and He healed them. \v 15 But the chief priests and scribes were indignant when they saw the wonders He performed and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”

\p \v 18 In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, He was hungry. \v 19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. \wj “May you never bear fruit again!”\wj* He said. And immediately the tree withered.
\p \v 20 When the disciples saw this, they marveled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”

\r (\ref Mark 11:27–33|MRK 11:27-33\ref*; \ref Luke 20:1–8|LUK 20:1-8\ref*)
\p \v 23 When Jesus returned to the temple courts and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You this authority?”
\p \wj \v 24 “I will also ask you one question,”\wj* Jesus replied, \wj “and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. \v 25 What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven or from men?”\wj*

\r (\ref Mark 12:1–12|MRK 12:1-12\ref*; \ref Luke 20:9–18|LUK 20:9-18\ref*)
\p \v 33 \wj Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey.\wj*
\p \v 34 \wj When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit. \v 35 But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.\wj*
\p \v 36 \wj Again, he sent other servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to them.\wj*
\p \v 37 \wj Finally, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.\wj*
\p \v 38 \wj But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance.’ \v 39 So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\wj*
\p \v 40 \wj Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?”\wj*
\p \v 41 “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the fruit at harvest time.”
\p \v 42 Jesus said to them, \wj “Have you never read in the Scriptures:\wj*

\s1 The Parable of the Banquet
\r (\ref Luke 14:15–24|LUK 14:15-24\ref*)
\p \v 1 Once again, Jesus spoke to them in parables: \wj \v 2 “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. \v 3 He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come.\wj*
\p \v 4 \wj Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’\wj*
\p \v 5 \wj But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business. \v 6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.\wj*
\p \v 7 \wj The king was enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city. \v 8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were not worthy. \v 9 Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’\wj*

\p \v 15 Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in His words. \v 16 They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

\p \v 26 \wj ‘You wicked, lazy servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. \v 27 Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received it back with interest.\wj*

\p Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”
\p \wj \v 64 “You have said it yourself,”\wj* Jesus answered. \wj “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power\f + \fr 26:64 \ft Or \fqa the right hand of the Mighty One\f* and coming on the clouds of heaven.”\wj*\f + \fr 26:64 \ft See \ref Psalm 110:1|ref="PSA 110:1"\ref* and Daniel 7:13.\f*
\p \v 65 At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. \v 66 What do you think?”
\p “He deserves to die,” they answered.
\p \v 67 Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him \v 68 and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”
\s1 Peter Denies Jesus
\r (\ref Mark 14:66–72|MRK 14:66-72\ref*; \ref Luke 22:54–62|LUK 22:54-62\ref*; \ref John 18:15–18|JHN 18:15-18\ref*)
\p \v 69 Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.
\p \v 70 But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”
\p \v 71 When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
\p \v 72 And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”
\p \v 73 After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”
\p \v 74 At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!”
\p And immediately a rooster crowed.
\p \v 75 Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: \wj “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”\wj* And he went outside and wept bitterly.

\s1 Jesus Delivered to Pilate
\r (\ref Mark 15:1–5|MRK 15:1-5\ref*)
\p \v 1 When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put Him to death. \v 2 They bound Him, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor.
\s1 Judas Hangs Himself
\r (\ref Zechariah 11:10–17|ZEC 11:10-17\ref*)
\p \v 3 When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. \v 4 “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said.
\p “What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.”
\p \v 5 So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
\p \v 6 The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” \v 7 After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. \v 8 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. \v 9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
\b 
\q1 “They took the thirty pieces of silver,
\q2 the price set on Him by the people of Israel,
\q1 \v 10 and they gave them for the potter’s field,
\q2 as the Lord had commanded me.”\f + \fr 27:10 \ft See \ref Jeremiah 19:1–15|ref="JER 19:1-15"\ref*, Jeremiah 32:6–9, and Zechariah 11:12–13.\f*
\s1 Jesus before Pilate
\r (\ref Luke 23:1–5|LUK 23:1-5\ref*; \ref John 18:28–40|JHN 18:28-40\ref*)
\p \v 11 Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?”
\p \wj “You have said so,”\wj* Jesus replied.
\p \v 12 And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer.
\p \v 13 Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?”
\p \v 14 But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement.
\s1 The Crowd Chooses Barabbas
\r (\ref Mark 15:6–11|MRK 15:6-11\ref*; \ref Luke 23:13–25|LUK 23:13-25\ref*)
\p \v 15 Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing. \v 16 At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.\f + \fr 27:16 \ft SBL and NA \fq Jesus Barabbas\ft ; also in verse 17, but universally called \fqa Barabbas \ft in verses 20, 21, and 26\f* \v 17 So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” \v 18 For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
\p \v 19 While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.”
\p \v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
\p \v 21 “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.
\p “Barabbas,” they replied.
\p \v 22 “What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked.
\p They all answered, “Crucify Him!”
\p \v 23 “Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?”
\p But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”
\s1 Pilate Washes His Hands
\r (\ref Mark 15:12–15|MRK 15:12-15\ref*)
\p \v 24 When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,\f + \fr 27:24 \ft Literally \fqa this blood\ft ; BYZ and TR \fqa this righteous blood\f*” he said. “You bear the responsibility.”
\p \v 25 All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
\p \v 26 So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.
\s1 The Soldiers Mock Jesus
\r (\ref Isaiah 50:4–11|ISA 50:4-11\ref*; \ref Mark 15:16–20|MRK 15:16-20\ref*; \ref Luke 22:63–65|LUK 22:63-65\ref*; \ref John 19:1–15|JHN 19:1-15\ref*)
\p \v 27 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around Him. \v 28 They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. \v 29 And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand, knelt down before Him, and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” \v 30 Then they spit on Him and took the staff and struck Him on the head repeatedly.
\p \v 31 After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him.
\s1 The Crucifixion
\r (\ref Psalm 22:1–31|PSA 22:1-31\ref*; \ref Mark 15:21–32|MRK 15:21-32\ref*; \ref Luke 23:26–43|LUK 23:26-43\ref*; \ref John 19:16–27|JHN 19:16-27\ref*)
\p \v 32 Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.
\p \v 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull, \v 34 they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.
\p \v 35 When they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments by casting lots.\f + \fr 27:35 \ft See \ref Psalm 22:18|ref="PSA 22:18"\ref*; TR includes \fqa to fulfill what was said through the prophet: “They divided My garments among them, and cast lots for My clothing.”\f* \v 36 And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.
\p \v 37 Above His head they posted the written charge against Him:
\p 
\pc THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p \v 38 Two robbers\f + \fr 27:38 \ft Or \fqa insurrectionists\ft ; also in verse 44\f* were crucified with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.
\p \v 39 And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads \v 40 and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
\p \v 41 In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked Him, saying, \v 42 “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him. \v 43 He trusts in God. Let God deliver Him now if He wants Him.\f + \fr 27:43 \ft \ref Psalm 22:8|ref="PSA 22:8"\ref*\f* For He said, \wj ‘I am the Son of God.’\wj*”
\p \v 44 In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him.
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\r (\ref Psalm 22:1–31|PSA 22:1-31\ref*; \ref Mark 15:33–41|MRK 15:33-41\ref*; \ref Luke 23:44–49|LUK 23:44-49\ref*; \ref John 19:28–30|JHN 19:28-30\ref*)
\p \v 45 From the sixth hour until the ninth hour\f + \fr 27:45 \ft That is, from noon until three in the afternoon\f* darkness came over all the land. \v 46 About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \wj “Eli, Eli,\f + \fr 27:46 \ft NE and WH \fqa Eloi, Eloi\f* lema sabachthani?”\wj* which means, \wj “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”\wj*\f + \fr 27:46 \ft \ref Psalm 22:1|ref="PSA 22:1"\ref*\f*
\p \v 47 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.” \v 48 One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine,\f + \fr 27:48 \ft Or \fqa filled it with wine vinegar\f* put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink.\f + \fr 27:48 \ft See \ref Psalm 69:21|ref="PSA 69:21"\ref*.\f*
\p \v 49 But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.”\f + \fr 27:49 \ft WH includes \fqa And another took a spear and pierced His side, and water and blood flowed out\ft ; see \ref John 19:34|ref="JHN 19:34"\ref*.\f*
\p \v 50 When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit. \v 51 At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, and the rocks were split. \v 52 The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. \v 53 After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.
\p \v 54 When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.”
\p \v 55 And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him. \v 56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
\s1 The Burial of Jesus
\r (\ref Isaiah 53:9–12|ISA 53:9-12\ref*; \ref Mark 15:42–47|MRK 15:42-47\ref*; \ref Luke 23:50–56|LUK 23:50-56\ref*; \ref John 19:38–42|JHN 19:38-42\ref*)
\p \v 57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus. \v 58 He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. \v 59 So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, \v 60 and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away. \v 61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
\s1 The Guards at the Tomb
\p \v 62 The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate. \v 63 “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, \wj ‘After three days I will rise again.’\wj* \v 64 So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.”
\p \v 65 “You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” \v 66 So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.

\s1 The Resurrection
\r (\ref Mark 16:1–8|MRK 16:1-8\ref*; \ref Luke 24:1–12|LUK 24:1-12\ref*; \ref John 20:1–9|JHN 20:1-9\ref*)
\p \v 1 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,\f + \fr 28:1 \ft Literally \fqa Now after the Sabbaths, it being dawn toward the first of the Sabbaths,\f* Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
\p \v 2 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. \v 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. \v 4 The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.
\p \v 5 But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. \v 6 He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.\f + \fr 28:6 \ft BYZ and TR \fqa where the Lord lay\f* \v 7 Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”
\p \v 8 So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. \v 9 Suddenly\f + \fr 28:9 \ft BYZ and TR \fqa They were going to tell His disciples, and suddenly\f* Jesus met them and said, \wj “Greetings!”\wj* They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. \wj \v 10 “Do not be afraid,”\wj* said Jesus. \wj “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”\wj*
\s1 The Report of the Guards
\p \v 11 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. \v 12 And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money \v 13 and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ \v 14 If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
\p \v 15 So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.
\s1 The Great Commission
\r (\ref Mark 16:14–18|MRK 16:14-18\ref*)
\p \v 16 Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated. \v 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.
\p \v 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, \wj “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. \v 19 Therefore go and make disciples\f + \fr 28:19 \ft Literally \fqa Having gone, therefore, make disciples\f* of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \v 20 and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”\wj*
